Rather than trying to identify which whale is present, we are going to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to localize the whale within the image.  In the case where there may or may not be a whale present at all this problem is sometimes called object detection.  Many successful competitors in the original competition found it improved their scores to first detect and localize the whales in the image before trying to identify them using a cropped and normalized image."

Instead of using a classification CNN in a sliding window fashion you can instead use some computationally cheaper, sensitive, but false alarm prone algorithm to generate candidate detections.  Examples of algorithms used for this process are cascade classifiers and selective search.  These candidate detections are then passed to the CNN to be classified by object type or filtered out as background noise.\n",

    "As mentioned earlier there is a great deal of redundant computation in the sliding window approach with overlapping windows.  Thankfully there is neat trick to avoid this redundancy.  The commonly used fully-connected layers towards the classification end of a CNN like Alexnet can be trivially replaced with convolutional layers.  These replacement layers have convolutional filters that are the same size as the feature map outputs for the previous layer and the number of filters is equal to the number of neurons in the fully-connected layer it replaces.  The benefit of making this replacement is that images of varying size can be input in to the network for classification.  If the input image is smaller than the expected image size for the network (called the receptive field of the network) then we will still just obtain a single classification for the image. However, if the image is larger than the receptive field then we will obtain a heatmap of classifications, much like we obtained from the sliding window approach.\n",

    "Now we will first look at how to train DetectNet on this dataset. A complete training run of DetectNet on this dataset takes several hours, so we have provided a trained model to experiment with.  Return to the main DIGITS screen and use the Models tab.  Open the \"whale_detectnet\" model and clone it.  Make the following changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* select your newly created \"whales_detectnet\" dataset\n",
    "* change the number of training epochs to 3  \n",
    "* change the batch size to 10\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to explore the network architecture visually by clicking the \"Visualize\" button.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you're ready to train, give the model a new name like \"whale_detectnet_2\" and click \"create\".  Training this model for just 3 epochs will still take about 8 minutes, but you should see both the coverage and bounding box training and validation loss values decreasing already.  You will also see the mean Average Precision (mAP) score begin to rise.  mAP is a combined measure of how well the network is able to detect the whale faces and how accurate it's bounding box estimates were for the validation dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model has finished training return to the pre-trained \"whale_detectnet\" model.  You will see that after 100 training epochs this model had not only converged to low training and validation loss values, but also a high mAP score.  Let's test this trained model against a validation image to see if it can find the whale face.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply set the visualization method to \"Bounding boxes\" and paste the following image path in:  `/home/ubuntu/data/whale/data_336x224/val/images/000000118.png`.  Be sure to select the \"Show visualizations and statistics\" checkbox and then click \"Test One\".  You should see DetectNet successfully detects the whale face and draws a bounding box, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![detectnet success](detectnet_success.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to test other images from the `/home/ubuntu/data/whale/data_336x224/val/images/` folder.  You will see that DetectNet is able to accurately detect most whale faces with a tightly drawn bounding box and has a very low false alarm rate.  Furthermore, inference is extremely fast with DetectNet.  Execute the following cell to use the Caffe command line interface to carry out an inference benchmark using the DetectNet architecture.  You should see that the average time taken to pass a single 336x224 pixel image forward through DetectNet is just 22ms."

    "<a id='answer1'></a>\n",
    "### Answer 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Random patches may end up containing whale faces too.  This is unlikely as the faces are typically only a very small part of the image and we have a large sample of random background patches which will almost entirely not contain whale faces.  We may also get whale bodies and tails in our background set, but this good as we are interested in localizing whale faces.\n",

    "<a id='answer2'></a>\n",
    "### Answer 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Some good things to try would be to use a larger number of randomly selected non-face patches and to balance the dataset by augmenting the existing face patches with random rotations, flips and scalings.  You could also train a model with a larger number of trainable parameters such as GoogleNet.\n",
